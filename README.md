# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions and provides a solution to improve reliability.

## Problem

Firebase Realtime Database transactions can fail if data is concurrently modified.  The provided `bug.js` example lacks proper error handling, leading to potential data inconsistencies and unexpected application behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a robust solution.  It includes comprehensive error handling within the transaction callback, along with retry logic to handle temporary failures.  This ensures that the operation is retried until successful, or until a defined number of attempts have been exhausted.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install firebase`
4. Configure your Firebase project in `firebase.json`.
5. Run `node bug.js` and `node bugSolution.js` to see the difference in behavior.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and retry mechanisms when working with asynchronous operations and concurrent data modification in a distributed environment.
